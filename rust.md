# Rust job listing

## Do you want to work on something that makes a difference?

The Daily Edit is here to _hack the news_ (in the nice sense). We're a news aggregator with a twist - we work out which details were omitted from articles and show them to the reader. We also detect misleading text and present all of this in an intuitive tool which
empowers readers to see through the news. Our mission is to help bridge the divides in society by presenting all news, regardless of source, as factually as possible.

We're an early-stage startup, we have funding and our software is (mostly) built. We plan to launch in Q1 2022, however there's an endless stream of work to be done so we're looking for two talented programmers to join our growing team.

### Here's what we can offer:

- Fully remote work
  - Our company is based in the USA
  - Current team is based in HK (fun fact: all founders are international airline pilots on the side)
  - No constraints around timezone
- Salary plus equity (100k USD - 130k USD negotiable with equity)
- Freedom to choose your tools
- Ownership of parts of our stack

### Here's what we're looking for:

- A track record of software you've made or worked on before. This doesn't have to be Rust.
- _Some_ Rust experience.
  - It's a new language so we don't expect mastery, we're happy to work together to learn.
  - Prefer some experience with the async ecosystem.
- Experience with relational databases.
- Experience creating HTTP servers. These also don't have to be in Rust.
- Proficiency with the basic tools of development (git, shells, etc).
- A willingness to grow your knowledge with us.

### These will get you bonus points:

- Experience with the Python science ecosystem.
- Any NLP experience.
- Previous work with Flutter.
- Devops experience (we really like Hashicorp's tools).
